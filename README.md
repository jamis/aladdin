# ALADDIN

Aladdin is the "Assisted Living Activities Director Diagnostic Information Notepad." Yes, it's a backronym. It's still awesome.

More helpfully, Aladdin is an app for assisted living facilities. With it, an activities director may track which residents are attending which activities, along with incidental notes. The activity director can use this information to look for trends and tailor their activities accordingly.
